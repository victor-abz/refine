<Sandpack>

We've completed building our app from scratch and gained knowledge about the fundamentals of Refine, including building a CRUD application using its hooks and components.

Now, its time to have a brief look at what we can use to improve Refine's development experience.

In this unit, we will cover the following topics:

- Using Refine's Inferencer package to generate views for our resources,
- Using Refine's CLI and learn about its features,
- Using Refine's Devtools to monitor and debug your queries and mutations.

These topics will help you to improve your development experience and make your development process more efficient.
