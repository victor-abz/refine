A web3 wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to send, receive, and store digital assets without the need for a third party. This example demonstrates how to log-in to our **refine** project with `Ethereum` and connect your [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) Web3 wallet. You can also learn how to send test ethereum with Metamask using the **refine** UI and how transactions are handled in this example.
