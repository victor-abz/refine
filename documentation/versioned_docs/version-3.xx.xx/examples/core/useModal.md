Using the `useModal` hook that comes with the **headless** version of **refine**, you may manage a modal. This hook is UI-independent and only includes show and close operations. You can create your UI as you like, and control it with the `useModal` hook.

[Refer to the **refine** useModal hook documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/hooks/ui/useModal/)
