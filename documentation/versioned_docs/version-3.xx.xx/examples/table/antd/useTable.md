You may use the `useTable` hook to process your data with features compatible with the Ant Design [Table](https://ant.design/components/table/) Component. You can be used as an out-of-the-box feature without needing to do extra operations for sorting, filtering, and pagination.

[Refer to the **refine** useTable hook documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/antd/hooks/table/useTable/)
