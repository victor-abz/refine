**refine** allows you to use all the features of [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) with `@pankod/refine-react-table` adapter. In this way, you can manage your server-side data operations. By using this adapter, you can directly use all the features of React Table in your **refine** project. For more information, you can view the live example or review the source code to see how it's used with Mantine.
