**refine** `useForm` is a hook that helps you manage methods such as `create`, `edit`, and `clone` within the form. In this example, we constructed forms that you may use to create, edit, and clone posts using the userForm hook. You may look at the example to see how it's used.

[Refer to the **refine** useForm hook documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/antd/hooks/form/useForm/)
