When working with form data, **refine** uses Ant Design's Form component. Ant Design enables us to create our own custom inputs within the Form.Item components. As a result, we may include our own custom input fields on the form. We use the Custom Input to enter a new value for the Content field in this example. If you want to add custom inputs to your project, you can follow this example and have information about how it is used.

[Refer to the Custom Inputs documentation for more information. â†’](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/antd/components/inputs/custom-inputs/)
