There are many ways to delete a record. In this tutorial, we will first use the `<DeleteButton/>` to delete a record and then we will learn how to enable the delete feature on the show page and edit page.

## Adding Delete Feature to List Page

Let's start by adding the delete feature to the list page. To do this, we will use the `<DeleteButton/>` component.

`<DeleteButton/>` is a **refine** component that is used to delete a record. When you click on the delete button, it will show a confirmation modal. If you confirm the deletion, it will delete the record.

[Refer to the `<DeleteButton/>` documentation for more information &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/mantine/components/buttons/delete-button/)

To add a delete feature to the blog posts table, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open the `src/pages/blog-posts/list.tsx` file on your editor.

2. Import the `<DeleteButton/>` component from `@pankod/refine-mantine`:

   ```tsx
   import { DeleteButton } from "@pankod/refine-mantine";
   ```

3. Add the `<DeleteButton/>` component to the `actions` column of the table as shown below:

   ```tsx
   {
       id: "actions",
       accessorKey: "id",
       header: "Actions",
       cell: function render({ getValue }) {
           return (
               <Group spacing="xs" noWrap>
                   <ShowButton
                       hideText
                       recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                   />
                   <EditButton
                       hideText
                       recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                   />
                   <DeleteButton
                       hideText
                       recordItemId={getValue() as string}
                   />
               </Group>
           );
       },
   },
   ```

   `recordItemId` is the id of the record you want to delete.

Now, you can try to delete a record from the list page. Just click on the delete button of the record you want to delete and confirm the deletion.

## Enabling Delete Feature on Show Page and Edit Page

When we define a resource, we can enable the delete feature on the show page and edit page by setting the `canDelete` property to `true` as shown below:

```tsx src="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import {
    MantineProvider,
    Global,
    NotificationsProvider,
    useNotificationProvider,
    LightTheme,
    Layout,
    ReadyPage,
    ErrorComponent,
} from "@pankod/refine-mantine";

import { BlogPostList } from "pages/blog-posts/list";
import { BlogPostEdit } from "pages/blog-posts/edit";
import { BlogPostShow } from "pages/blog-posts/show";
import { BlogPostCreate } from "pages/blog-posts/create";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <MantineProvider theme={LightTheme} withNormalizeCSS withGlobalStyles>
            <Global styles={{ body: { WebkitFontSmoothing: "auto" } }} />
            <NotificationsProvider position="top-right">
                <Refine
                    routerProvider={routerProvider}
                    dataProvider={dataProvider(
                        "https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev",
                    )}
                    notificationProvider={useNotificationProvider}
                    ReadyPage={ReadyPage}
                    catchAll={<ErrorComponent />}
                    Layout={Layout}
                    resources={[
                        {
                            name: "blog_posts",
                            list: BlogPostList,
                            edit: BlogPostEdit,
                            show: BlogPostShow,
                            create: BlogPostCreate,
                            /highlight-next-line
                            canDelete: true,
                        },
                    ]}
                />
            </NotificationsProvider>
        </MantineProvider>
    );
};
export default App;
```

After setting the `canDelete` property to `true`, you will see a delete button on the show page and edit page. Because we used the `<Show/>` and `<Edit/>` components in the show page and edit page, the delete button will be added automatically in these components.

[Refer to the `<Refine/>` documentation for more information about the `canDelete` property &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/components/refine-config/#candelete)

You can also use `useDelete` hook provided by **refine** to delete a record.

[Refer to the `useDelete` documentation for more information information &#8594](/docs/3.xx.xx/api-reference/core/hooks/data/useDelete/)
